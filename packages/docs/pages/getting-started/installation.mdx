# Installation

You can install using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), but you can use it with [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) too.

Headless Stepper is compatible with React 16.8.0 and up.

## NPM

```bash
npm install headless-stepper
```

## Yarn

```bash
yarn add headless-stepper
```

## UNPKG (as UMD module)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/headless-stepper@VERSION/index.umd.js"></script>
```

Replace `VERSION` with the version you want to use.
