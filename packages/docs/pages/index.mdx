<Features />

**Headless Stepper** is a library for creating steppers.
So, instead of you spend a lot of time focusing on the stepper logic, now, you'll focus only UI. These hooks do not render any style for you, so you can use any style you want.

## Why?

Headless Stepper is built with React hooks, so, it is easy to use, and easy to test as well. The proposal is providing a set of utility functions to build a rich stepper, without pain and fully accessible. In resume, this is a stepper utility.
